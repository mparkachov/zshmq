# Zero Shell Message Queue (zshmq)

**Zero Shell Message Queue (zshmq)** is a lightweight, [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/)-inspired **message bus for POSIX shells**.
It provides a simple **publish/subscribe** mechanism using only **FIFOs (named pipes)** - no sockets, daemons, or dependencies.

> Think of it as *ZeroMQ for the Unix shell* - pure inter-process messaging built entirely with standard POSIX tools.

---

## Overview

- **Pure POSIX:** Works anywhere `sh`, `mkfifo`, and `read` exist.
- **Publish/Subscribe:** Multiple publishers and dynamic subscribers.
- **Zero dependencies:** Uses only core Unix utilities.
- **Efficient:** Blocking FIFO I/O -> near-zero CPU when idle.
- **ZeroMQ-like CLI:** Familiar commands (`pub`, `sub`, `dispatch`, etc.).
- **Tiny:** A single portable shell script.

---

## Motivation

ZeroMQ is great - but sometimes you just need **inter-process messaging** between shell scripts, without compiling or linking anything.

`zshmq` brings the same conceptual model - **topics**, **publishers**, and **subscribers** - into pure shell territory.

It's perfect for:
- Event-driven shell workflows  
- Lightweight coordination between processes  
- Teaching message-passing fundamentals  

---

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Shell | POSIX-compliant (`bash`, `dash`, `zsh`, `ksh`, etc.) |
| Tools | Core POSIX utilities (`mkfifo`, `grep`, `cat`, `awk`, `read`, `kill`, `rm`) bundled with your shell environment; any extras ship as Git submodules |
| OS | Linux, macOS, BSD - any Unix with FIFOs |

---

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1[Publisher 1] --> B[( /tmp/zshmq/bus )]
    P2[Publisher 2] --> B
    B --> D[Dispatcher]
    D --> S1[Subscriber A - Pattern: ^ALERT]
    D --> S2[Subscriber B - Pattern: ^INFO]
```

- Publishers write messages into /tmp/zshmq/bus.
- The Dispatcher reads messages and routes them to subscribers whose patterns match.
- Each Subscriber owns its own FIFO (e.g. /tmp/zshmq/sub.<pid>).

## Installation

Clone and install manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mparkachov/zshmq.git
cd zshmq
chmod +x zshmq
sudo cp zshmq /usr/local/bin/
```

Or run locally:
```bash
./zshmq <command> ...
```

## Development Guidelines

- Initialize tool dependencies with `git submodule update --init --recursive`; every non-shell helper ships as a Git submodule.
- Assume only a POSIX shell exists on the host; vendor any additional tooling through submodules.
- Name new functions after their ZeroMQ counterparts (or close equivalents) to signal behavioral parity.

## Testing

Run the ShellSpec suite:
```sh
make test
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Initialize
```bash
zshmq init
```
Creates /tmp/zshmq/bus and the state file for subscriptions.

### Step 2: Start Dispatcher
```bash
zshmq dispatch
```
Runs the router that listens for messages and subscription updates.

### Step 3: Subscribe to a Topic
```bash
zshmq sub '^ALERT'
```
Creates /tmp/zshmq/sub.<pid> and prints matching messages:

Subscribed to '^ALERT'
ALERT: CPU overload

### Step 4: Publish Messages
```bash
zshmq pub "ALERT: CPU overload"
zshmq pub "INFO: Cooling active"
```
Messages are routed to subscribers with matching filters.

### Step 5: List Active Subscribers
```bash
zshmq list
```
Example output:

PID     FIFO                   PATTERN
2314    /tmp/zshmq/sub.2314    ^ALERT
2318    /tmp/zshmq/sub.2318    ^INFO

### Step 6: Unsubscribe
```bash
zshmq unsub
```
Removes your FIFO and deregisters from the dispatcher.

### Step 7: Stop Dispatcher
```bash
zshmq stop
```
Gracefully terminates the router and cleans up /tmp/zshmq/bus.

### Command Reference
Command	Description
zshmq init	Initialize FIFO bus and state file
zshmq dispatch	Start the dispatcher process
zshmq pub <message>	Publish a message
zshmq sub <pattern>	Subscribe to matching messages
zshmq list	Show active subscribers
zshmq unsub	Unregister the current subscriber
zshmq stop	Stop the dispatcher
zshmq --help	Show usage
zshmq --version	Display version info

### Environment Variables
Variable	Default	Description
ZSHMQ_BUS	/tmp/zshmq/bus	Main FIFO path
ZSHMQ_STATE	/tmp/zshmq/state	Subscription table
ZSHMQ_DEBUG	0	Verbose mode flag

### Example Session

Terminal 1 - Dispatcher
```bash
zshmq dispatch
```

Terminal 2 - Subscriber
```bash
zshmq sub '^ALERT'
```

Terminal 3 - Publisher
```bash
zshmq pub "ALERT: Disk full"
zshmq pub "INFO: Backup started"
```

Subscriber Output
```bash
ALERT: Disk full
```
## Implementation Summary

- Dispatcher uses a blocking read on /tmp/zshmq/bus (no polling).
- Subscriptions stored in /tmp/zshmq/state as PATTERN|FIFO.
- Subscribers each have a private FIFO (/tmp/zshmq/sub.<pid>).
- Multiple publishers supported (atomic writes up to PIPE_BUF).
- Fully POSIX; no arrays or Bash-specific syntax.

## Limitations

- One reader per FIFO (FIFO property).
- No guaranteed delivery or message persistence.
- Filtering uses shell patterns (case), not full regex.
- Single host only (no networking).
- Single broker per machine because all instances share the /tmp/zshmq/ directory.

## Roadmap

- Implement REQ/REP and PUSH/PULL patterns
- Add persistence and re-delivery
- Add metrics and TTLs
- Optional Unix-socket backend

## Design Philosophy

**Principle	Description**
Zero dependencies	Pure POSIX implementation
Brokerless	Simple dispatcher; no background services
Transparent messages	Human-readable text
Efficient	Blocking I/O, 0 % CPU idle
Educational	Teaches message-passing concepts with FIFOs
